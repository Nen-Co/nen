# Nen Ecosystem ‚ö°

The Nen Ecosystem is a collection of high-performance libraries built on shared principles of **static memory allocation** and **inline optimization**. Our goal is to create a suite of tools that offer predictable performance and minimal overhead.

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

* **[nen-db](https://github.com/Nen-Co/nen-db)**: A graph database engineered with static memory management.
* **[nen-net](https://github.com/Nen-Co/nen-net)**: A high-performance HTTP/TCP framework for efficient networking.
* **[nen-io](https://github.com/Nen-Co/nen-io)**: A zero-allocation I/O library.
* **[nen-json](https://github.com/Nen-Co/nen-json)**: A library for high-speed JSON processing.
* **[nen-cli](https://github.com/Nen-Co/nen-cli)**: A unified CLI and package management tool.

## Core Principles üí°

* **Static Memory**: Zero dynamic allocation ensures predictable performance.
* **Inline Functions**: Critical functions are optimized for maximum speed.
* **Zero Overhead**: We design for a minimal runtime cost and memory footprint.
* **Interoperable**: Our libraries are designed to work together seamlessly.

## Getting Started

Each project can be used independently. Please see the individual project directories for specific documentation and usage examples.
